1.Trapping Rain Water (DONE but we can redo it again later)
well there is a condition for water holding which i assume would be that there are blocks
on the left and the right of it which should also be related to the height

2.Robot collisions

an array of structs perhaps which include a health variable and a direction variable
give R and L,boolean values and create an AND gate to process it perhaps

if they collide,the smaller health robot will get removed (hence why i believe a linked list is better)
aka the robot in the array of robots (aka structs) gets removed
